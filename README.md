## Introduction

This repository is designed to help you understand and implement various data structures. Each project includes a detailed implementation of a data structure, its operations, and use cases. The code examples are written in Java, but the concepts can be applied to other programming languages as well.

## Projects

### Stacks

- **Description**: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Operations**: Push, Pop, Peek, IsEmpty
- **Use Cases**: Expression evaluation, backtracking algorithms

### Queues

- **Description**: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
- **Operations**: Enqueue, Dequeue, Front, IsEmpty
- **Use Cases**: Scheduling, buffering

### Linked Structures

- **Description**: Linked structures include singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
- **Operations**: Insert, Delete, Search, Traverse
- **Use Cases**: Dynamic memory allocation, implementing other data structures

### Binary Search Trees (BSTs)

- **Description**: A BST is a binary tree in which each node has at most two children, and the left child is less than the parent node, while the right child is greater.
- **Operations**: Insert, Delete, Search, Inorder Traversal
- **Use Cases**: Searching, sorting

### Balanced Search Trees

- **Description**: Balanced search trees include AVL trees, Red-Black trees, and B-trees.
- **Operations**: Insert, Delete, Search, Balance
- **Use Cases**: Maintaining sorted data, database indexing

### Priority Queues

- **Description**: A priority queue is an abstract data type where each element has a priority, and the element with the highest priority is served first.
- **Operations**: Insert, ExtractMax, Peek
- **Use Cases**: Task scheduling, Dijkstra's algorithm

### Hash Tables

- **Description**: A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function.
- **Operations**: Insert, Delete, Search
- **Use Cases**: Implementing associative arrays, database indexing

### Graphs

- **Description**: A graph is a collection of nodes connected by edges. Graphs can be directed or undirected.
- **Operations**: AddVertex, AddEdge, RemoveVertex, RemoveEdge, Search (BFS, DFS)
- **Use Cases**: Network routing, social networks

### Sorting Algorithms

- **Description**: Sorting algorithms include Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and others.
- **Operations**: Sort
- **Use Cases**: Organizing data, searching

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects, navigate to the respective directory and check out the detailed code and implementation of each project with provided testcases or user created ones. Feel free to download the project with its respective git commant to test, edit or inspect the code in your own editor.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or new data structures to add, please open a pull request and I will look into it as soon as I can.
